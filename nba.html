    <h2>National Basketball Association</h2>

    <p>The National Basketball Association, or NBA, is a professional basketball league
      composed of 30 teams across North America featuring the best basketball players in 
      the world. The NBA is a collection of 30 teams, broken down by two conferences with 
      three divisions apiece. The Western Conference plays host to the Northwest, Pacific
      and Southwest Divisions. The Eastern Conference's 15 squads also break up across three
      divisions: the Atlantic, Southeast and Central.</p>
    
    <p>The National Basketball Association was founded at the Commodore Hotel in New York.
      Maurice Podoloff was the league's first president, a title later changed to commissioner.
      Eleven teams were part of that league, orginally called the Basketball Association of
      America. Podoloff's name is now emblazoned on the NBA MVP trophy.</p>

    <p>The NBA's list of all-time Legends continues to grow with each new generation, boasting 
      names like:</p> 

      <ul>
        <li>LeBron James</li>
        <li>Michael Jordan</li>
        <li>Bill Russell</li>
        <li>Stephen Curry</li>
        <li>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</li>
        <li>Wilt Chamberlain</li>
        <li>Kobe Bryant</li>
        <li>Magic Johnson</li>
        <li>Larry Bird</li>
      </ul>
      

    <h2>How many teams make the Playoffs?</h2>

    <p>The top eight teams in each Conference reach the postseason, with the No. 1 seed facing
      No. 8 in the first round, No. 2 vs No. 7 and so on. Each round features a best-of-seven
      series with a 2-2-1-1-1 format (two games at the top seed's home court, two games at the
      lower seed's home, then back and forth one game at a time).</p>

    <h2>What is the Playoff Play-in Tournament?</h2>

    <p>The NBA Board of Governors approved a proposal to implement a Playoff Play-In Tournament.
      The Play-In Tournament will determine the teams that will fill the seventh and eighth playoff
      seeds in each conference.</p>
