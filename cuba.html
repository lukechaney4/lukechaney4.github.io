    <h1>Cuba</h1>

    <p>The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 
      <time datetime="1492">1492</time> and following its development as a Spanish colony during the next several 
      centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana 
      became the launching pointfor the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru.</p>

    <p>Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement and occasional rebellions were harshly suppressed.
      <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans 
      in overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established Cuban independence from Spain in <time datetime="1898">1898</time> 
      and, following three-and-a-half years of subsequent U.S. military rule, Cuba became an independent republic in 
      <time datetime="1902">1902</time> after which the island experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by 
      the military and corrupt politicians.</p>

    <h3>Telecommunication Systems</h3>
    
    <p>Internet availability has increased substantially over the past few years, but only about 64 percent of 
      Cubans have Internet access, and even fewer Cubans--about 60 percent of the population--have access to cell 
      phone service; in 2021 the Cuban Government passed a decree that strengthened its authority to censor 
      Internet and telephonic communications.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19578348">Broadcast Media</a></h3>

    <p>Government owns and controls all broadcast media: five national TV channels (Cubavision, Tele Rebelde, 
      Multivision, Educational Channel 1 and 2), two international channels (Cubavision Internacional and Caribe), 
      16 regional TV stations, 6 national radio networks and multiple regional stations; the Cuban Government beams 
      over the Radio-TV Marti signal; although private ownership of electronic media is prohibited, several online 
      independent news sites exist; those that are not openly critical of the government are often tolerated.</p>

      sex trafficking and sex tourism occur within Cuba; traffickers exploit Cubans in sex trafficking and forced labor 
      in South America, the Caribbean, Asia, Africa, the Mediterranean, and the U.S.</p>
