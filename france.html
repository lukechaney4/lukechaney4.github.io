    <h1>France</h1>

    <p>France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and
    is a leader among European nations. It plays an influential global role
    as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the 
    G-7, the G-20, the EU, and other multilateral organizations. France rejoined
    NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009, reversing DE GAULLE's 
    1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO.</p>

    <p>Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing
    system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely 
    parliamentary administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation and 
    cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of 
    Europe, including the introduction of a common currency, the euro, in January 
    1999. In the early 21st century, five French overseas entities - French Guiana,
    Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were 
    made part of France proper.</p>
