    <h1>Luke Chaney</h1>

    <p>The 2023 NFL league year and trading period began on March 15.  
    On March 13, teams were allowed to exercise options for 2023 on 
    players with option clauses in their contracts, submit qualifying 
    offers to their pending restricted free agents, and submit a Minimum 
    Salary Tender to retain exclusive negotiating rights to their players 
    with expiring 2022 contracts and fewer than three accrued seasons of 
    free agent credit.</p>

    <p>Teams were required to be under the salary cap using the "top 51" 
    definition (in which the 51 highest paid-players on the team's payroll 
    must have a combined salary cap). On March 15, clubs were allowed to 
    contact and begin contract negotiations with players whose contracts 
    had expired and thus became unrestricted free agents. 2024 free agents
    include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Kirk Cousins</li>
      <li>Ryan Tannehill</li>
      <li>Leonard Williams</li>
      <li>Chris Jones</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In 1947, the NFL replaced the reserve rule with the "one year option" 
    rule, which allowed teams to use a reserve clause one time after the 
    expiration of a player's contract. The option year could not contain the 
    reserve clause, which gave players the ability to negotiate and enter a 
    contract with any team. Players became free agents, free to sign anywhere, 
    for the first time.</p>

    <h2>Positions</h2>

    <h3>Quarterback</h3>

    <p>In modern American football, the starting quarterback is usually the 
    leader of the offense, and their successes and failures can have a 
    significant impact on the fortunes of their team.</p>

    <h3>Running back</h3>

    <p>The halfback (HB) or tailback (TB) position is responsible for carrying
    the ball on the majority of running plays, and may frequently be used as a 
    receiver on short (or sometimes long, depending on the system) passing plays.</p>

    <h3>Wide receiver</h3>

    <p>Especially fast receivers are typically perceived as "deep threats," while
    those with good hands and perhaps shifty moves may be regarded as "possession 
    receivers" prized for running crossing routes across the middle of the field, 
    and, ideally, converting third-down situations.</p>
